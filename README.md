Engaging Business and Economics Learners using Short Videos, Podcasts and Articles 

How does the use of support material such as short videos, podcasts and articles help activate students in the classroom? 

The initial assessment of teaching practices highlighted the challenge of activating learners in the classroom. Reducing the monotony of teaching practices and a greater variety in teaching methods were called for. Indeed, there are several advantages or justifications to employing blended learning methods in teaching. Young people grow up surrounded by technologies, which will have a direct influence on their world of experience and, therefore, also affect how they construct knowledge (Duffy, 2009). According to Gillespie (2017), active learning practices focus on the process of how instead of what learners learn. The key to active learning is in engaging learners. A variety of pedagogical techniques aim to engage learners, for instance changing seating plans, interactive discussions, Q&A sessions, use of multimedia. Here, I will focus on the use of audiovisual sources.  

Audiovisual sources add interest to the instructional event, which can in turn boost motivation. These sources also provide learners with an alternative representation of information and can lead to a deeper processing of information. Essentially, blended or multimodal methods can help make complex information more easily comprehensible (Shah and Freedman, 2003). Audiovisual sources can also act as facilitators for classroom discussions (Clark and Mayer, 2002). Furthermore, audiovisual sources also help cater to different learning styles (Picciano, 2009; Sankey, Birch & Gardiner). 

Teaching practice is always framed by a particular curricular context and learning objectives. The Cambridge syllabus for Economics and Business requires analytical thinking, reasoning and application skills. In general, relating learners’ knowledge to real-world situations is a key aspect in learning Economics and Business. Relating the more theoretical or mathematical topics that are taught in class to real-world events allows learners to make sense of what they are learning, leading to deeper learning. This will then allow them to better assimilate knowledge and apply it to other cases.  

In the past three years of teaching Economics and Business, it has become clear that learners’ performance in analytical questions depends on the way the subject is taught. My pedagogical approach during the first year of teaching was more theoretical and knowledge-based. In the past two years, I have focused more on working through real-world cases where knowledge is used to understand issues in businesses and to propose solutions to these real-world cases. Theory will of course remain an important aspect of teaching, particularly in Economics, but the aim should be to anchor this as much as possible in real-world phenomena. 

Thanks to initiatives like CORE and FT Secondary School, we have access to high quality resources that help both diversify teaching methods and make connections between theory and real-world phenomena. I occasionally show short videos from the news as these relate to a topic covered in class; as such, the media are aligned with expected learning outcomes (Clark and Mayer, 2002). In general, these videos are relatively short, lasting around 5 minutes. These videos have appeared to have a strong impact on learner’s memory. On several occasions, learners have subsequently referenced these videos in written work, even weeks later.   

 To this end, in September 2019, I began to compile a database of relevant support material in form of videos, articles, podcasts, or thematic sections dedicated to a particular subject from a variety of sources, such as, Financial Times (access at LML for our students), news outlets (Wallstreet Journal, BBC, CNBC, Educ’Arte, ...). The material is referenced with keywords, which makes it easy to match the various sources to a given topic. This material can be used either to revise knowledge that has been covered in previous lessons or to introduce a new topic.  Supported with an in-class activity, as for example an accompanying worksheet or a questionnaire, activates learner’s ability to analyse and critically evaluate the material shown. In this process, learners also gain awareness of the resources available to them and are encouraged to independently seek them out.  

The indicators and measures that will be used to assess the degree of success of these methods will be based on (i) learners’ feedback at the end of the lesson, (ii) online survey completed by learners, and (iii) semi structured interviews with a sample of learners.  

 

This project adresses the teacher’s competencies as listed in the “référentiel des compétences” (IFEN). The material used in videos, podcasts and articles apply economic and business topics to wider issues, such as politics, demographics, climate, medical issues, …. This allows learners to establish links between the subject matter of economics and business on one hand and biology, geography, and sociology on the other hand (see competency 7.3 in the “référentiel des compétences”: Savoir mobiliser les compétences transversales).   

As mentioned earlier, learners have shown that they are very receptive to this material. It can therefore be stated that this approach helps learners to give a meaning to what they are learning (see competency 4.1.11 in the “référentiel des compétences”: s’engager dans une démarche qui donne du sens au travail scolaire et à susciter le désir d’apprendre).
