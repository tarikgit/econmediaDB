Media Content for Teaching Economics

This project aims at centralizing a variety of sources and material that can be used in the classroom for teaching economics. The core of the project is a database that will be maintained and updated with new material over the next months. The web front end of the database is under construction. This should make it more user-friendly for potential users of the data.
